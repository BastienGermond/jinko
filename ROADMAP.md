# Jinko Roadmap

This document contains the roadmap of features that are being added to jinko. It will
be expanded. If you want to contribute, this a good place to start!

## Parsing

* [x] Constants
* [ ] Constants with escaping characters
* [x] Variable assignment
* [x] Allow variables named "mut\*"
* [x] Function calls
* [x] Code blocks
* [x] If condition
* [x] Else condition
* [x] For loop
* [x] While loop
* [x] Loop loop
* [x] Function definition

## Behavior

* [ ] A variable cannot be assigned the `void` type
* [x] Immutable variables cannot be assigned twice
* [x] `-i|--interactive` option allows you to run a script and then open a REPL

## Execution

* [x] Constants
* [x] Variables
* [x] Variable assignment
* [x] Function calls
* [x] Code blocks
* [x] If condition
* [x] Else condition
* [x] For loop
* [x] While loop
* [x] Loop loop
* [x] Test functions
* [x] Tests for execution

## Typechecker

* [x] Add typechecker trait

* [ ] Generic types
* [ ] Sum/Multi types

## Optimizer

* [x] Add typechecker trait
* [x] Constants
* [x] Variables
* [x] Variable assignment
