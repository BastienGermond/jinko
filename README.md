# jinko
`jinko` is a small and safe interpreted language using the [`stir`](https://github.com/cohenarthur/stir) intermediate representation

## Requirements

* [ ] If a function does not return `void`, its return value should always be used.
* [ ] You can wrap unsound code in `audit` blocks, to make it easier to review.
* [ ] Variables are immutable by default.
* [ ] Tests should be an integral part of the language
    * [ ] This includes unit testing
    * [ ] This includes mocking
* [ ] The language must be simple
