# In this directory, tests need two source files. One "includer" and one "includee".
# Therefore, each file shall be named "incl_*.jk" and "incl_*_includer.jk" for the source
# that includes it. The includer file shall be passed as argument to the interpreter,
# and the includee shall simply be included by the includer.
